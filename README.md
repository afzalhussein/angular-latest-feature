# angular-latest-feature
As of last knowledge update in January 2022, Angular has been evolving rapidly with frequent updates and new features. Here are some of the latest features and concepts in Angular that an advanced JavaScript developer might find interesting:

1. **Ivy Renderer:**
   - Ivy is Angular's latest rendering engine, designed to improve bundle size, runtime performance, and debugging.
   - Tree-shakable: Ivy allows better tree-shaking capabilities, reducing the final bundle size by eliminating unused code.
   - Improved debugging: It provides enhanced debugging capabilities with better error messages and stack traces.

2. **Strict Mode:**
   - Angular introduces a strict mode to enforce stricter coding and type-checking rules during development.
   - Enhanced type checking: Helps catch more errors during development by enabling strict mode settings in the TypeScript configuration.

3. **NGRX:**
   - NGRX is a state management library for Angular applications, based on Redux principles.
   - Integration with Angular: NGRX helps manage complex application state and facilitates unidirectional data flow by using actions, reducers, and selectors.

4. **Angular Universal:**
   - Angular Universal allows for server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications.
   - SEO optimization: SSR improves SEO by rendering the initial view on the server, enhancing web crawlers' ability to index content.

5. **Component Harnesses:**
   - Harnesses provide a way to interact with and test Angular components in isolation.
   - Improves testing: Enables more comprehensive testing of components by creating a harness for interacting with their APIs programmatically.

6. **Differential Loading:**
   - Angular supports differential loading, which generates separate bundles for modern and legacy browsers.
   - Improved performance: Loads smaller bundles for modern browsers while still providing compatibility for older browsers.

7. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Lazy loading allows loading specific parts of the application on-demand, improving initial load times.
   - Enhanced performance: Modules and components are loaded only when required, reducing the initial bundle size.

8. **Angular CLI Enhancements:**
   - The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) offers various enhancements like ng update, ng deploy, and ng add.
   - Simplifies development: ng update updates dependencies, ng deploy facilitates deployment, and ng add integrates additional functionalities effortlessly.

9. **RxJS Integration:**
   - Angular heavily utilizes RxJS for reactive programming paradigms.
   - Reactive Extensions: Observable-based operations simplify asynchronous programming and data handling in Angular applications.

10. **Angular DevTools:**
    - Angular offers browser extensions and tools like Augury to debug and inspect Angular applications efficiently.
    - Streamlined debugging: DevTools aid in inspecting components, performance profiling, and state management.

To understand these features better, exploring the official Angular documentation, trying out sample applications, and following Angular blogs, articles, and community discussions can provide practical examples and in-depth explanations for an advanced JavaScript developer aiming to master Angular's latest capabilities. Always check the Angular official website or community resources for the most up-to-date information beyond my last update in January 2022.
